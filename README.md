# Basil
Basil is a recipe database that allows users to search for recipes 
using keywords. They can then access a youtube video or text instructions.

This project was done as part of the Personal Projects Competition for the SeattleU ACM club Fall 2022. We had 5 weeks to create a project of our choosing.

# Project Status
This is a completed submission. Dev has slowed 11/18/2022

# Roadmap
Possible improvements: 

    - make our own database / allow users to add their own recipes
    - display all or a set number of random recipes on the landing page
    - allow users to make notes/rate recipes they try (user accounts?)
